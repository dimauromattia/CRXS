**********


This software package is developed to easily calculate cross sections (XS) for the 
production of antiprotons and antideuteron as required in cosmic-ray (CR) physics.
The package is based on c++ and builds all functions into a library. Furthermore, 
it provides an interface to python 3. 

The library named CRXS is intalled to cpp/lib and
the header files are saved in cpp/include.


To install this sofware do the following.

**********************
* Required software: *
**********************

- gsl 
- cmake 
- swig     (optional)
- python 3 (optional)
   * numpy
   * scipy
   * matplotlib


**********************
* Build the software *
**********************

The c++ library is build with cmake and the python interface is created by swig.
All commands to build the software are summarised in the Makefile. If you want 
to build everything, simply use

$ make

Otherwise you can use the options: 
  1) cpp_only, to build only the c++ library
  2) example, to build the example.cpp which links to the CRXS library
  3) debug, to build the c++ library with debug symbols

To uninstall everything use

$ make clean

*********************
* Build docu:       *
*********************

Go to the folder documentation and build it by

$ doxygen Doxyfile

Open the file html/index.html 

We recommend to build the documentation before building the software package.

*********************
* Build project:    *
*********************

On a Mac with Xcode you may build a project by
  1) creating a folder in the directory cpp (e.g. xcode) and change into this new directory. Then type
  2) $ cmake -G Xcode ..
